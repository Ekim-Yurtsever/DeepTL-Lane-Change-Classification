# DeepTL-Lane-Change-Classification
Infers the risk level of lane change video clips. The related paper is submitted to IEEE ITSC 2019. [Mask R-CNN implementation by Matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) is utilized for the segmentation part in this project.

## Feautes:
* A novel deep spatiotemporal framework with segmentation mask transfer for risky action detection in short lane change video clips
* using solely a camera for the task
* extensive comparison of state-of-the-art deep backbone models.

## Examples:

Here are two examples. The left lane change is classified as safe and the right lane change is classifed as risky.
